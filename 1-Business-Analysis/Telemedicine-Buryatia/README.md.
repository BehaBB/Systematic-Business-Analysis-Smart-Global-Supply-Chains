# Buryatia Telemedicine Project

This folder contains business analysis artifacts for the Buryatia Telemedicine initiative, integrating AI-driven supply chain optimization for medical equipment and pharmaceuticals.

## Project Overview
The project aims to design a regional telemedicine system with:
- **Cross-Functional Analysis:** Stakeholders from health authorities, IT, and practitioners.
- **Process Modeling:** BPMN 2.0 for As-Is/To-Be mapping.
- **Risk Assessment:** SWOT and PESTLE analysis.
- **AI Integration:** Predictive analytics for supply shortages (30–40% reduction, based on Patent ID: 5cc2a64d-7f71-4a1f-9450-9b093d28fada).
