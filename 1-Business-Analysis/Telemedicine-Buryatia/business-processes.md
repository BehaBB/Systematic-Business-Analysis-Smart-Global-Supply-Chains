# Business Processes Analysis - Buryatia Telemedicine Platform

## Current State (As-Is) Processes

### Patient Consultation Flow - Traditional Approach
1. **Symptom Recognition**
   - Patient experiences health issues at home
   - Consults family or local traditional healer first
   - Decides if modern medical help is needed

2. **Travel Preparation**
   - Arranges transportation (often difficult in remote areas)
   - Plans for 1-3 day absence from work/family
   - Prepares for significant travel expenses

3. **Hospital Visit**
   - Travels 2-6 hours to nearest district hospital
   - Registers in paper-based system (Russian language only)
   - Waits 2-4 hours for doctor availability
   - Receives consultation without traditional medicine context

4. **Treatment Decision**
   - Gets prescription for modern medicine only
   - No integration with traditional healing practices
   - Potential referral to regional specialist (+2 days travel)

5. **Follow-up Challenges**
   - Difficult to get follow-up consultations
   - No continuous monitoring of chronic conditions
   - Limited communication with healthcare providers

### Traditional Healer Consultation Process
1. **Community Access**
   - Patients visit healers in their communities
   - Oral tradition knowledge transfer
   - Seasonal and local plant-based treatments

   - Limited documentation of outcomes
   - Knowledge isolation between healers
